To me 'coding' up a method or workflow in Excel without VBA is the ultimate case of explaining it simply! So while I do code in FORTRAN, C++ (20 years experience), VBA, R and Python I challenge myselt to put methods and workflows in Excel to provide hands-on experiential learning and reach more students. Why do I feel this way?

* in STEM everyone has access to Excel. This is even more true with the online applications Microsoft now provides.
* the vast majority of scientists and engineers know the basics of working with Excel
* one can easily interogate a method or workflow in Excel, just click on the cell to see the equation
* there is no set up needed to get students started with these dmeonstrations

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!

* I can be reached at mpyrcz@austin.utexas.edu.

I'm always happy to discuss,

*Michael*
